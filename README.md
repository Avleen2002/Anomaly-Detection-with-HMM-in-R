# Anomaly Detection in Power Usage Data using Hidden Markov Models

## Overview:
This project explores the application of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for detecting anomalies in power usage data. The study encompasses various stages, including data pre-processing, feature engineering via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), model training/testing, and anomaly detection. The dataset comprises recorded household power consumption, which undergoes linear interpolation to handle missing values before partitioning into training and testing sets. The trained HMM is evaluated using log-likelihood and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), with insights provided into anomaly thresholds for real-time monitoring systems.

## Acknowledgments:
I want to express sincere gratitude to Dr. Uwe Glasser for their guidance and support throughout this project. Their expertise and feedback have been invaluable in shaping our understanding of Hidden Markov Models and anomaly detection techniques.
